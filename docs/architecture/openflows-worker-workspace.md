# OpenFlows Worker Workspace — Internal Architecture

**Document type:** Internal architecture (deep-dive)
**Scope:** Subsystem 03 of the OpenFlows system — the ephemeral worker workspaces (FORGE, SENTINEL, VESSEL, LORE) that the Controller provisions from Coder templates.
**Companion docs:** `openflows-system-architecture.md` (system-wide, authoritative; see §5.4 for multi-tenant isolation and §13 for network policy), `openflows-controller.md` (the process that provisions them), `openflows-a2a-relay.md` (the A2A executor surface FORGE hosts).

---

## 1. Role & Responsibilities

Each worker workspace is a **short-lived, disposable Coder workspace** built from a role-specific template. It is the *execution seat* for one agent on one ticket. Worker workspaces are deliberately thin and deliberately isolated:

- **They hold no credentials.** No LLM API keys (the AI Gateway lives in the control plane) and no raw GitHub PATs (git identity flows through Coder's external GitHub OAuth).
- **They hold no agent framework.** The AI loop runs in the control plane (Coder Chats API); the workspace only hosts the `openflows` binary (whose `worker` command surface is the coordination CLI) and the repo checkout.
- **They are the only place that talks to Redis** — via the `openflows worker` command surface (Harness A), never directly.
- **They host the Agent Harness (Harness B)** — the agent-facing plugin surface (`orchestration/`: hooks, commands, skills, MCP, personas, standards) that drives the Worker surface of Harness A. **Do not conflate the two harnesses**: A is the compiled command surface (the `openflows worker` CLI: Redis client + gate + A2A executor); B is the discoverable filesystem package the agent calls, and it does **not** touch Redis on its own (see §5.6). Both ship in the same `openflows` binary and the `agent-harness` package — there is one executable.
- **The agent bootstraps hook-first.** On startup the agent **runs the role's `SessionStart` hook** and its stdout becomes the opening context (live assignment, phase, workflow), then the agent is **tool- and hook-capable** through the Agent Harness (`commands/*` + policy hooks) — the Claude Code / Codex model. The Controller provisions and binds the workspace, but the assignment context is **read from live Redis by the hook**, not baked into a chat first message (see §5.5).

A worker workspace's responsibilities (per role) are:

- **FORGE** — plan, implement, test, and open a PR; also hosts the A2A verification executor daemon.
- **SENTINEL** — adversarially review FORGE's plan and PR; approve gates; may delegate verification to FORGE via A2A.
- **VESSEL** — watch CI, resolve merge conflicts, squash-merge approved PRs.
- **LORE** (optional) — update changelog/ADRs after merge.

The core asymmetry holds here as everywhere: **Coder governs WHERE agents run (the workspace), OpenFlows governs HOW they coordinate (the `openflows worker` coordination contract, supervised by the Controller).**

### Required environment (injected by the workspace template)

`openflows worker` is fail-fast on these (`binary/src/worker.rs:207` `require_env`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis SharedStore connection |
| `OPENFLOWS_TENANT` | Tenant identifier (namespaces every Redis key) |
| `OPENFLOWS_TICKET` | Current ticket ID (e.g. `T-42`) — doubles as the A2A `pair_id` |
| `OPENFLOWS_ROLE` | Role (forge / sentinel / vessel / lore) — drives gate authorization |
| `CODER_WORKSPACE_ID` | Workspace identifier, used in heartbeat + A2A audit trail |
| `A2A_RELAY_ADDR` | A2A relay network address (`openflows-nexus:3000`); FORGE executor + SENTINEL client |

---

## 3. Workspace boot sequence

On provision, the Coder template's **startup script** runs a fixed sequence (§5.1 of the system doc):

1. **Install Harness A (the `openflows` binary)** — mandatory; startup fails if it is missing or not on `PATH`. It is **pulled from a GitHub Release at provision time**, not baked into a base image (except the local dev override). See §3.1 for the full release/install model.
2. **Install the Agent Harness (B)** — pulled/provisioned as a first-class, versioned artifact and unpacked into the workspace (today the Controller's `Provisioner` copies its files in via `~/.openflows/`; the target is a packaged install with a pinned version). Under the target plugin-FS contract (see §7) this yields a self-describing `~/.openflows/` tree the Coder agent calls explicitly. See §3.1a for the release/install model.
3. **Wire environment** — set the ticket/role/tenant/Redis/A2A variables above.
4. **Acquire the repository** — the worker copies the repo from a shared **golden mount clone** (rather than a per-spawn network clone) and checks out the pair branch (FORGE) or the target for review (SENTINEL). See §3.2.
5. **Start the heartbeat** daemon (writes a Redis key every 30s with a 120s TTL — see §6).
6. **Verify the Agent Harness (B) surface** — skills, MCP, standards, and persona are installed and discoverable (see §4).
7. **FORGE only: start the A2A executor daemon** — Harness A `openflows worker verify serve` (see §5.4).

Under the hood, file materialization is performed by the **Provisioner** (`crates/provisioner`) over a `WorkspaceTransport` (`crates/provisioner/src/transport.rs`) that executes shell commands inside the workspace via the Coder client — because workspaces don't share a filesystem, the Controller copies artifacts *into* the workspace rather than mounting a volume.

### 3.1 The Harness A release & install model

The worker installs **Harness A** (the `openflows` binary, whose `worker` command surface is the coordination CLI) by runtime download at boot (`crates/coder-client/templates/openflows-forge/main.tf:85-123`, mirrored in the sentinel/vessel/lore templates):

1. **Local dev override** — if `/opt/openflows-dev/openflows` is bind-mounted (local testing), copy it and skip the download.
2. **Download** — `curl -fsSL --retry 3` from `…/releases/download/{harness_version}/openflows-{harness_version}-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz` (the single `openflows` release tarball), where `harness_version` defaults to `harness-edge` (latest main-branch build) or a pinned tag/version.
3. **Extract + install** — untar to `/tmp`, locate the `openflows-*` dir, `sudo mv` the `openflows` binary to `/usr/local/bin/openflows`, `chmod +x`.
4. **Fail loudly** — retry 3x; if still not executable, log `FATAL` and `exit 1` so the workspace never comes up uncoordinated.

**Release concept — one binary everywhere.** There is **one** `openflows` binary that contains both the Controller (`openflows run`) and the Worker surface (`openflows worker …`); the four roles (FORGE, SENTINEL, VESSEL, LORE) are not separate binaries — they are the same worker command surface driven by different `OPENFLOWS_ROLE`/`OPENFLOWS_TICKET` env plus the role-scoped Agent Harness (B) content (hooks/skills/persona). The release therefore publishes two independently releasable pieces:

| Artifact | Contains | Deployed to |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `openflows-<ver>-<target>.tar.gz` | The single binary (`openflows`, `openflows-doctor`) | Control plane (`openflows run`) **and** every worker workspace (`openflows worker …`), **installed** at boot (§3.1) |
| `agent-harness-<ver>-<target>.tar.gz` | **Harness B** — hooks · commands · skills · mcp · personas · standards (the §7 plugin tree) | Every worker workspace, **installed** at boot via `openflows install` (§3.1a) |

Both the Controller and Harness A share **one version number and one binary** (no divergent versions, no separate artifact to reconcile). The asset name is exact and versioned (`openflows-<ver>-<target>.tar.gz`) so unattended startup scripts can `curl` a stable, predictable URL and (with the shipped `.sha256`) verify integrity before installing. The Agent Harness (B) is its **own independently versioned, installed artifact** (see §3.1a) — which is exactly why the two "harness" names stay distinct even though Harness A is no longer a separate executable.

> **Alignment note:** the templates reference the worker asset as `openflows-{harness_version}-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`, matching the single `openflows` release tarball produced by `release-assets.yml`, so the worker and the controller now resolve the same artifact name.

### 3.1a The Agent Harness (B) release & install model

The Agent Harness (Harness B) is **installed and provisioned just like Harness A** — not copied in ad hoc. The two harnesses are deliberately symmetric: Harness A ships inside the single `openflows` binary (the `openflows worker` command surface), Harness B is the installed *plugin package*, and both must be present for the workspace to coordinate. There are two coexisting install transports today, converging on one in the target:

1. **Controller-side provisioning (today).** The `Provisioner` (`crates/provisioner/src/provision.rs:27`) copies the Agent Harness files *into* the workspace over `WorkspaceTransport` — skills → `.agents/skills/`, `.mcp.json`, standards, personas/`AGENTS.md`. Because workspaces share no filesystem, the Controller copies rather than mounts (see the transport note at the end of §3).
2. **Workspace-side package install (target).** The Agent Harness ships as a **versioned, independently released artifact** (its own project), pulled at boot and unpacked to `~/.openflows/` by `openflows install` (§7) — the plugin-tree analogue of Harness A's download-and-install. This gives B the same properties A has: a pinned/`-edge` version, a predictably named asset with integrity verification, and a **fail-loud** rule (the workspace never boots with a partially installed Agent Harness).

**Versioning.** Harness A and the Controller share one version number and one binary; the Agent Harness (B) is **versioned independently** because it is its own project. The workspace pins/validates whichever `agent-harness` revision it resolved, mirroring how Harness A validates its `harness_version` — so a worker is never held to an outdated or partial Agent Harness.

> This is the part that previously read as "materialize content": the Agent Harness is **not** loose files to be sprinkled in — it is a release artifact to be installed, exactly like the `openflows` binary. The docs, the release pipeline, and the boot must treat B as a first-class installed component.

### 3.2 Repo acquisition: the golden mount clone

Every FORGE (or SENTINEL) spawn currently runs its own `git clone`/`pull` into its private docker volume (`openflows-forge/main.tf:213-225`). A full clone on every ephemeral spawn is slow and wasteful. The target design removes the network clone from the per-workspace path by reusing the existing tenant-shared read-only volume:

**Topology (one network fetch, many local copies).**

```
                NEXUS (control plane, has creds + network)  [per tenant]
   golden repo on shared volume  /home/coder/.openflows/artifacts/repo/

                                                                    ▼

                                                                    │
        ┌───────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
        ▼                               ▼
   FORGE workspace                 SENTINEL workspace

   2. refresh to latest (git fetch) 2. refresh to latest (git fetch)
   3. checkout pair branch          3. checkout target branch
   4. begin work                    4. begin work
```

1. **Golden clone on the shared volume.** NEXUS maintains a fresh checkout of the target repo at `/home/coder/.openflows/artifacts/repo/` on the tenant-scoped `openflows-artifacts-<tenant>` volume it already owns (`openflows-nexus/main.tf:164-181`; NEXUS already pulls/clones the repo at startup, `openflows-nexus/main.tf:117-122`). NEXUS holds the GitHub credentials and network egress, so the expensive fetch happens **once**, in the control plane.
2. **Refresh before copy.** When a workspace that needs the repo is about to be provisioned (or on a short cadence), NEXUS runs `git fetch --prune` + `reset --hard origin/<target>` on the golden clone so the snapshot is current **before** any worker takes a copy. This is the "updates are pulled before any workspace gets its copy" guarantee.
3. **Per-workspace copy (not clone), then refresh, then checkout.** The worker startup script **copies** the golden tree from the read-only shared volume into its own docker volume: `cp -a /home/coder/.openflows/artifacts/repo/. /home/coder/workspace/`. This is a local filesystem copy — no network, no git creds in the worker, orders of magnitude cheaper than a per-spawn clone. **Before any checkout,** the worker refreshes its local copy to the latest (`git fetch` — see the next block), and only then checks out the pair branch (FORGE) or review target (SENTINEL).

**Why this preserves the security/isolation guarantees:**

- **Per-tenant scoping.** The golden clone, its shared volume, and all copies are scoped per tenant: the volume is `openflows-artifacts-<tenant>` and lives under NEXUS's tenant workspace, so one tenant's repo snapshot is never visible to another tenant's workspaces. This composes with the `ns:{tenant}:` Redis keyspace for full tenant isolation.
- **Read-only source.** The shared volume is mounted `read_only = true` (`openflows-forge/main.tf:296-301`), so a worker can never mutate the golden tree; NEXUS is the sole writer.
- **Independent physical copies.** Each worker still gets its **own** tree on its **own** docker volume, so FORGE and SENTINEL never share a writable filesystem — the review-integrity property (SENTINEL cannot touch FORGE's tree) is intact. Golden-copying is purely a *seed*; it is not a live shared mount for writes.
- **No credentials in workers.** The copy is offline; the only git/network dependency stays in NEXUS.

**Freshness before work (no stale versions):**

- **The golden tree is refreshed before any copy** — NEXUS runs `git fetch --prune` + `reset --hard origin/<target>` on the golden clone before a worker takes its snapshot, so the snapshot reflects the current target, not a stale one.
- **The workspace refreshes to the latest before checking out** — after `cp -a`, the worker runs a small `git fetch` on its local copy **first**, then checks out the current target/pair branch from the fetched head. The copy is the cheap seed; the **refresh always precedes the checkout** so the worker plans and builds against the up-to-date tree, never a stale checkout. (Ordering in the workspace: copy → refresh → checkout → begin work.)
- The same freshness principle applies to the Harness A binary (§3.1): a workspace pulling a pinned `harness_version` verifies it resolves to the expected version (and `harness-edge` always tracks the latest), so the worker isn't held to an outdated binary.

**Caveats to design around:**

- **Branch checkout is per-copy.** The pair branch or review target is checked out in each copy, so two workspaces branching from the same golden snapshot don't collide.
- **Ordering is copy → refresh → checkout → work.** The worker's refresh is a small `git fetch` on its local copy (still cheap relative to a full clone); it must run **before the branch checkout** and before any plan/build step so work never begins on stale content.
- **Disk cost.** Each spawn holds a full physical copy on its volume; this trades network time for disk, which is the intended trade (cheap, local, offline-seedable).

## 4. Provisioning: installing the Agent Harness (B)

The **Provisioner** is the Controller-side install transport for the Agent Harness (B) — the way B's files get into the workspace today, in parallel with Harness A's binary install (see §3.1a for the relationship and the workspace-side package-install target). Everything this section installs is the **Agent Harness (B)** — the agent-facing plugin surface. `Provisioner::provision_role` (`provision.rs:27`) reads the live agent registry for the role and writes into the workspace:

1. **Skills** → `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for each skill in the registry entry (`provision.rs:56`). The Coder Agent discovers and loads these via the `read_skill` tool. A permission-denied on the skills dir is logged and skipped — skills are optional, not fatal.
2. **MCP** → `.mcp.json` from the role's `mcp` config (`provision.rs:79`). This is merged client-side with centrally-managed servers from the Coder dashboard.
3. **Standards** → `CODING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `REVIEW.md` at workspace root (`provision.rs:89`).
4. **Persona** → the role's `<role>.agent.md` is copied as both `<role>.agent.md` **and `AGENTS.md`** (`provision.rs:115-132`). Coder's agents read `AGENTS.md` from the working directory (and `~/.coder/AGENTS.md`) and inject it into the system prompt for every conversation **server-side** — so the persona persists across chats rather than being bundled into a fragile first request.

These are the pieces that, in the §7 target, come from the **Agent Harness package** installed into `~/.openflows/` — keeping the binary (Harness A) and the agent-facing content (Harness B) each installed, versioned, and owned independently.

---

## 5. The agent-side stack

### 5.1 Harness A — `openflows worker`, the ONLY Redis client

Harness A is the worker command surface of the `openflows` binary (`binary/src/worker.rs`) that is the single interface between the agent and the shared store. The agent never calls Redis or Coder directly — the Agent Harness (B) surface it sees wraps these commands and funnels all durable actions through this surface (see §5.6). Command surface:

```bash
openflows worker dispatch read              # task payload
openflows worker status get|set <phase>     # phase state machine
openflows worker gate approve|status        # SENTINEL single-use gate
openflows worker pr get|opened              # record PR
openflows worker handoff write              # CONTRACT.md handoff
openflows worker review submit              # SENTINEL verdict
openflows worker merge done                 # VESSEL merge record
openflows worker plan read|write            # PLAN.md in Redis
openflows worker heartbeat start|stop       # liveness
openflows worker verify request|serve|list  # A2A surface
```

Design guarantees (all in `crates/openflows-harness/src/store.rs`):

- **Typed validation** — every write is serde-validated; malformed writes exit non-zero and the agent reads stderr and retries. `redis-cli` is disallowed.
- **Gate enforcement** — `status_set` enforces the gated phase machine: a fresh ticket must enter via `planning` (or `blocked`); leaving `planning` requires consuming a SENTINEL approval via atomic Redis **`GETDEL`** (single-use). FORGE cannot approve its own plan (`authorize_gate_approver` rejects any non-SENTINEL role, `store.rs:96`).
- **Tenant awareness** — every key is `ns:{tenant}:...` (`store.rs:146`).

The phase state machine (enforced by the harness):

```
planning ──[gate]──▶ building ──▶ testing ──▶ review_ready
    │                                  │            │
    ▼                                  ▼            ▼
 blocked (stuck)                   blocked      awaiting_human (review)
                                                  │
                                                  ▼
                                              merged (VESSEL)
```

### 5.2 Agent Harness (B) hooks — the built-in startup + tool/policy surface

Hooks are a component of the **Agent Harness (B)** and they are the **primary startup behaviour** of a worker agent — the way the agent comes alive, modelled on advanced coding agents (Claude Code, Codex): on startup the agent **runs the startup hook**, reads its output as its initial context, and from then on is capable of **tool calls and further hook invocations** — all surfaced by the Agent Harness.

The **`SessionStart` hook is the built-in bootstrap**, not the chat's first message:

- **On boot (`SessionStart`), the agent runs `session_start.sh`** and its stdout becomes the agent's opening context: live assignment (`dispatch read`), current phase + history (`status get`), the workflow to follow, and the harness command reference (see the `session_start.sh` body, `orchestration/plugin/hooks/forge/session_start.sh`, which declares itself the *"SOLE entrypoint"* and reads live Redis through the harness). This is hook-driven startup as **built-in behaviour**, identical in spirit to how Claude Code's `SessionStart` hook seeds a session — not a Controller-authored chat message.
- **After boot the agent is tool-capable.** It calls the Agent Harness's `commands/*` (tool calls over Harness A) and its policy hooks (`pre_bash_guard.sh`, `pre_write_check.sh`, `post_write_lint.sh`, `stop_require_artifact.sh`) before/after risky actions — the same lifecycle advanced coding agents expose. The role-scoped set:

| Event | FORGE | SENTINEL | Purpose / Blocks? |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| `SessionStart` | `session_start.sh` | `session_start.sh` | **Built-in bootstrap**: run at startup; stdout becomes the agent's opening context (assignment/phase/workflow) |
| `PreToolUse(Bash)` | `pre_bash_guard.sh` | `pre_bash_readonly_guard.sh` | Block destructive/out-of-policy bash (**Yes, exit 2**) |
| `PreToolUse(Write)` | `pre_write_check.sh` | — | Prevent writes outside workspace |
| `PostToolUse` | `post_write_lint.sh` | `post_write_validate.sh` | Auto-lint / validate after edits (No) |
| `PreCompact` | `pre_compact_handoff.sh` | — | Persist state before compaction (No) |
| `SubagentStart/Stop` | `subagent_start.sh` / `subagent_stop.sh` | same | Subagent lifecycle cleanup |
| `Stop` | `stop_require_artifact.sh` | `stop_require_eval.sh` | Refuse stop until artifact/PR exists (**Yes, exit 2**) |

**How this is delivered as built-in behaviour, engine-agnostically.** The template installs the role's hooks to `~/.openflows/hooks/` and registers the event map in `hooks.json` (`orchestration/plugin/hooks/hooks.json`). On the target contract (§7), `openflows install` writes this self-describing `~/.openflows/` tree, and `AGENTS.md` teaches the agent that its startup hook and tools live there. The startup behaviour then does **not** depend on a particular engine's internal event system or on a Controller-authored first message — any agent that can execute a script and read its output gets the same bootstrap, and the same callable hook/tool surface. (Today a Claude-Code/CLI hook map in `~/.claude/settings.json` wires these for the CLI path; the target contract makes the `~/.openflows/` tree the single, engine-independent source.)

> **This supersedes the "first-message bootstrap" model.** The chat's first message is at most a minimal seed/pointer; the load-bearing context — live assignment, phase, workflow, command reference — comes from the `SessionStart` hook the agent itself runs, exactly as advanced coding agents boot. See §5.5 for the reconciled bootstrap flow.

### 5.3 Skills, MCP, standards, persona

- **Skills** — `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, role-scoped, discovered via `read_skill`. `shared-harness-protocol` teaches the coordination commands.
- **MCP** — workspace `.mcp.json` (per-role) is merged with Coder-dashboard central servers.
- **Standards + persona** — `CODING.md`/`SECURITY.md`/`REVIEW.md` and the `AGENTS.md` persona delivered server-side.

### 5.4 The A2A executor (FORGE only)

FORGE workspaces additionally run `openflows worker verify serve` (`store.rs:621`) as a supervised background daemon. This is the A2A **executor** side of delegated verification (see `docs/architecture/openflows-a2a-relay.md`):

1. Health-checks the nexus relay, logs "✓ Forge verify executor ready".
2. Polls `tasks/claim` for its pair (only the `forge` role is permitted to claim).
3. On claim, runs the command via the sandbox (`executor.rs`) with **process-group isolation, timeout enforcement, and bounded (10 KB tail) output capture**.
4. Streams progress (`tasks/push_progress`), monitors cancellation (`tasks/cancel` → atomic cancel token), and submits the terminal result (`tasks/complete`), which the relay mirrors to Redis.
5. Loops until SIGTERM; a crash is restarted by the supervisor.

### 5.5 How the agent bootstraps: hook-driven startup, tool+hook capable

The worker agent starts just like an advanced coding agent (Claude Code, Codex): it **runs a startup hook at session start**, reads that hook's output as its opening context, and is then **capable of tool calls and further hook invocations** — all provided by the Agent Harness (B). This is the primary, engine-agnostic bootstrap; it does **not** lean on the Controller stuffing context into the chat's first message.

**The startup sequence (built-in behaviour, not a Controller-authored prompt):**

1. **Boot** — the worker installs Harness A (binary) and the Agent Harness (B) package (§3/§3.1a), and starts with `AGENTS.md` + `hooks.json` teaching where its startup hook and tools live.
2. **SessionStart hook runs automatically** — the agent executes `session_start.sh` (its role's entrypoint) and its stdout becomes the opening context: live `dispatch read`, current phase + history via `status get`, the workflow, and the `openflows worker` command reference. This is *by design* the sole entrypoint (`orchestration/plugin/hooks/forge/session_start.sh`), reading live coordination state through Harness A — not a frozen prompt.
3. **The agent becomes tool+hook capable** — it calls the Agent Harness `commands/*` (tool calls over Harness A) and invokes its policy hooks (`pre_bash_guard.sh`, `pre_write_check.sh`, `post_write_lint.sh`, `stop_require_artifact.sh`) around risky actions, exactly as Claude Code / Codex expose a lifecycle. See §5.2.
4. **First message is only a seed/pointer** — the chat's first message at most points the agent at its harness ("your startup hook is at `~/.openflows/hooks`; run it"). It is deliberately **not** the source of authority: assignment, phase, and workflow all come from live Redis via the startup hook, so state can never go stale in a hardcoded prompt.

**Today vs. target.** Today there are two wiring paths: the default Coder chat agent gets context from a first message + server-side `AGENTS.md`, while a Claude-Code/CLI fallback fires the hook engine via `~/.claude/settings.json`. The event maps are engine-specific and the hook path is only honoured by the CLI engine. **The target (§7) unifies them**: `openflows install` exposes hooks and commands under `~/.openflows/` as **discoverable, callable tools**, so the *default* Coder agent bootstraps by running `session_start.sh` itself and calls the other hooks as tools — the same built-in behavior, on every engine.

> **Net:** hook-driven startup is the real model. "First-message bootstrap with empty hooks" is the legacy fallback. The agent reads and runs its startup hook at boot, and is then fully tool- and hook-capable through the Agent Harness — which is the whole point of having an Agent Harness at all.

### 5.6 The two harnesses — and the Controller ↔ harness coordination contract

OpenFlows has **two** distinct things that both carry the word "harness". They are different artifacts with different owners, and this section exists so they are never conflated.

| | **Harness A — `openflows worker` (in the `openflows` binary)** | **Harness B — the Agent Harness (the plugin package)** |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | A compiled **command surface** — the typed Redis client + gate + A2A executor | A **filesystem plugin package** — the agent-facing surface (hooks, commands, skills, MCP, personas, standards) |
| **Crate / source** | `crates/openflows-harness` (lib) + `binary/src/worker.rs` → `openflows worker` | `orchestration/` (`plugin/` + `agent/`) — an **independent project** |
| **Touches Redis?** | **Yes — it is the ONLY Redis client in a workspace** | No — it reads/writes coordination state *through* the worker surface |
| **Consumed by** | The workspace boot, the A2A relay, and the Controller (for `gate`) | The agent itself, via `~/.openflows/`, `read_skill`, `.mcp.json`, `AGENTS.md` |
| **Release** | Ships **inside** the single `openflows-<ver>-<target>.tar.gz` (`openflows worker …`) — **installed at boot** | Ships as an `agent-harness-<ver>-<target>.tar.gz` package — **also installed at boot** (§3.1a); separate project |
| **Duplicated name source** | the crate is named `openflows-harness`; its CLI is the `worker` subcommand of `openflows` | the plugin skillset grew a `shared-harness-protocol` skill; docs called it "the harness" |

**The relationship:** the **Agent Harness (B)** is the discoverable, agent-facing surface. Its `commands/*.md` are **wrappers over** the worker surface (e.g. `dispatch.md → openflows worker dispatch read`), and its skills/AGENTS.md teach and point the agent at that surface. The **worker surface (A)** is the only thing that actually negotiates with the Controller over Redis and the A2A relay. **Both live in installed components** — A inside the `openflows` binary at boot (§3.1), B's package via provisioning/install (§3.1a) — and under the target §7 contract `openflows install` unpacks B's tree into `~/.openflows/` so the agent calls hooks/commands explicitly.

**The Controller ↔ harness contract (which is with A, the worker surface).** There are exactly **two** processes in the whole system that write to the SharedStore: the **Controller** (in the `openflows-nexus` control-plane workspace) and the **`openflows worker` surface (Harness A)** inside each worker workspace. They are the two ground terms and must not be conflated:

| | **Controller** | **Harness A (`openflows worker`)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Where it lives** | `openflows-nexus` control-plane workspace (long-lived, trusted) | Ephemeral worker workspaces (short-lived, untrusted) |
| **Executable** | `openflows run` (`binary/src/bin/agentflow.rs`) | `openflows worker …` (`binary/src/worker.rs` + `crates/openflows-harness`) |
| **Redis client** | `pocketflow-core::SharedStore` (writes orchestration state) | the *only* Redis client inside a workspace |
| **Credentials** | Holds Coder/GitHub tokens; has network egress | Holds **no** keys; restricted egress |
| **Governs** | WHERE the agent runs + coordination state | HOW the agent reads/writes coordination state |

The two never call each other directly over a private channel — their entire interaction is the **SharedStore keyspace + the A2A relay**, both on the control plane:

```

```

**Who writes what (the two-writer rule):**

| Artifact | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `tickets`, `worker_slots`, `pending_prs`, `registry_json`, `control:*` | Controller | Controller |
| `ticket:{id}:dispatch:{role}` | Controller | Harness A (`dispatch read`) |
| `ticket:{id}:status` | Harness A (`status set`) | Controller |
| `ticket:{id}:gate:{phase}` | Harness A (`gate approve`) | Controller + Harness A (`status set` consumes it) |
| `ticket:{id}:review:{role}` | Harness A (`review submit`) | Controller |
| `ticket:{id}:chat:{role}` | Controller | Controller |
| `ticket:{id}:handoff` | Harness A (`handoff write`) | Controller + Harness A (`handoff read`) |
| `heartbeat:{role}:{ticket}` | Harness A (`heartbeat start`) | Controller (`reconcile`) |
| `pair:{id}:verification`, `audit:a2a:*` | Harness A executor / relay mirror | Controller + SENTINEL |

**Why this is a contract, not just shared state:**
- **Typed both directions.** The worker writes through Harness A (`openflows worker`, serde-validated; malformed writes exit non-zero and are never accepted). The Controller writes through `pocketflow-core` typed keys. The keys above, and their serde types, are the *interface* between the two processes.
- **The Agent Harness (B) never speaks Redis.** It is the surface the agent sees; every durable action it triggers funnels into the binary's typed commands. This is why "the only Redis client" is a property of **A**, and why B can live in its own project without weakening the guarantee.
- **Gate is enforced by the composition.** The Controller provisions the ticket into `planning`; Harness A refuses to leave `planning` without consuming a SENTINEL-written gate token via atomic `GETDEL` (`store.rs:96`, `authorize_gate_approver`). Neither side can skip the other's step.
- **The A2A relay is the only non-Redis channel, and it is still Controller-hosted.** FORGE's executor (A: `verify serve`) dials out to the relay inside NEXUS; SENTINEL submits through it. Even this live channel terminates in the control plane and mirrors results to Redis (§5.4, `openflows-a2a-relay.md`).
- **Recovery stays on the Controller side.** If a worker goes silent, the heartbeat key self-expires (§6) and the Controller — never the worker — reconciles and re-provisions. The worker has no authority over its own lifecycle.

This section is the answer to "how do the Controller and the harnesses interoperate?": the **Agent Harness (B)** presents the agent-facing surface, the **binary (Harness A)** is the sole Redis client that negotiates with the Controller over the typed tenant-scoped keyspace plus the Controller-hosted A2A relay, with the asymmetry held throughout — the Controller decides, Harness A executes.

## 6. Heartbeat & liveness

The heartbeat is the worker's **"still alive" beacon**. It is a long-lived background daemon (`openflows worker heartbeat start`, launched by the startup script — e.g. `openflows-forge/main.tf:237`) that lets NEXUS tell a workspace (and its agent) is running — and, crucially, when it has **crashed or gone silent** — without NEXUS having to poke every container.

```
  WORKER workspace                       REDIS (SharedStore)                    NEXUS (Controller)
        │  heartbeat start (daemon)            │                                   │
        │  loop every 30s:                      │                                   │
        │  write key with TTL 120s ────────────▶│ ns:{tenant}:heartbeat:{role}:{ticket} │
        │                                      │   { ts, ws_id, status:"running" }    │
        │                                      │                                   │
        │                                      │        every poll pass reads key ──▶│
        │                                      │◀─────────────────────────────────── │  reconcile():
        │                                      │                                    │  key present  → alive
        │  [daemon dies] key expires (120s) ──▶│  (self-deleting)                    │  silent >90s → STALE → recover
```

**What the daemon writes** (`heartbeat_start`, `crates/openflows-harness/src/store.rs:500`): every **30 seconds** it writes a `HeartbeatRecord` to Redis:

```
key:    ns:{tenant}:heartbeat:{role}:{ticket}
value:  { "ts": <unix-epoch seconds>, "ws_id": "<CODER_WORKSPACE_ID>", "status": "running" }
TTL:    120 seconds  (EX(120))
```

**How the numbers work together:**

| Number | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **30s** | write cadence — the daemon refreshes the TTL every 30s |
| **120s** | Redis TTL — if the daemon stops writing, the key **expires on its own** within ~2 minutes |
| **90s** | NEXUS staleness threshold — a worker silent for >90s is declared **stale** |

Because the key is **self-expiring** (120s TTL), NEXUS doesn't need a "last seen" tracker: if the key is present, the workspace is alive; if it's gone, the workspace has been dead for at most ~2 minutes. NEXUS's `reconcile()` declares a worker **stale after 90s** of silence and treats the workspace/chat as crashed and recoverable (system doc §7.5).

**What NEXUS does on stale:** the stale worker is marked for **recovery** — tear down and re-provision the workspace, re-assign the ticket — bounded to **3 recovery attempts** before the ticket escalates to `awaiting_human`. Heartbeat staleness is one of the primary inputs to this self-healing loop.

**Why a separate daemon, not the agent writing inline:** the beacon must keep firing even while the LLM agent is idle between tool calls, thinking, or blocked on a gate. A `nohup`'d background process outlives any single agent action, and it honors the rule that `openflows worker` is the only Redis client in the workspace. `heartbeat_stop` deletes the key on clean teardown.

## 7. The target contract: the Agent Harness (B) as an installed plugin filesystem the agent calls

The Agent Harness (**Harness B**) — the `orchestration/` plugin content: hooks, commands, skills, MCP, personas, standards — is the agent-facing half of the system (see §5.6 for the A/B split). Like Harness A, it is an **installed, versioned component**: the symmetric counterpart to the `openflows` binary's worker-surface install (§3.1/§3.1a). Today its delivery is partial — hooks via the CLI engine's `~/.claude/settings.json`, skills via `read_skill`, commands bundled rather than installed to one place. The current wiring (§5.2, §5.5) makes the Coder agent's behavior depend on **which agent engine** is present: hooks only fire through the CLI engine's `~/.claude/settings.json`, and the default Coder agent never sees them. The target design removes that dependency by installing the Agent Harness as **a self-describing filesystem plugin surface** that *any* agent — including the default Coder Chat agent — can discover and invoke as ordinary agentic tool calls. Because the Agent Harness is slated to **split into its own project**, this contract is also the boundary definition for that split: B is installed and versioned independently of the `openflows` binary, exactly as A is.

Concrete target layout produced by the boot — the two harnesses each installed: Harness A's binary on `PATH`, and the Agent Harness package unpacked to `~/.openflows/` (an `openflows install` subcommand writes this tree):

```
~/.openflows/                        # plugin root (installed by the Agent Harness package)
├── bin/openflows                    # Harness A — the `openflows` binary, on PATH (already installed)
├── hooks/
│   ├── hooks.json                   # machine-readable event → script map
│   ├── session_start.sh             # bootstrap: emit assignment/phase/workflow
│   ├── pre_bash_guard.sh            # policy: block destructive bash
│   ├── pre_write_check.sh
│   ├── post_write_lint.sh
│   └── stop_require_artifact.sh
├── commands/                        # agentic entry points (wrappers over the harness)
│   ├── dispatch.md | dispatch.sh    # → openflows worker dispatch read
│   ├── status.md  | status.sh       # → openflows worker status get|set
│   ├── gate.md    | gate.sh         # → openflows worker gate approve|status
│   ├── plan.md    | plan.sh         # → openflows worker plan read|write
│   └── verify.md  | verify.sh       # → openflows worker verify request|list
├── skills/…/SKILL.md                # read_skill discovery (already provisioned)
├── mcp.json                         # merged per-role + central
└── AGENTS.md                        # server-injected persona:
                                     #   "your tools live at ~/.openflows; call them"
```

The contract has four properties:

1. **Explicit discovery, no hidden engine.** `AGENTS.md` (server-injected every conversation) points the agent at `~/.openflows/hooks/hooks.json` and `~/.openflows/commands/*` as its tool registry. Readability is independent of whether the engine supports hook events.
2. **Hooks become callable scripts — and the startup hook is the first call.** "SessionStart" is the agent's **built-in first behaviour**: a one-time invocation of `session_start.sh` whose stdout is captured as its opening context (live dispatch, phase, workflow). Policy hooks (`pre_bash_guard.sh`, `stop_require_artifact.sh`) are scripts the agent invokes (or a thin wrapper calls) before risky actions. No reliance on any engine's internal event system or on a Controller-authored first message.
3. **Harness A commands stay the real tools.** `openflows worker` remains the only Redis client; the `commands/` wrappers just make the surface discoverable and uniform. Security properties (typed writes, gate `GETDEL`, `authorize_gate_approver`) are unchanged.
4. **Self-contained install.** `openflows install` (or the template step) writes the whole tree, replacing the Python `~/.claude/settings.json` snippet as the canonical wiring. The tree's content is owned by the Agent Harness project, so installing it is how a workspace pulls in Harness B.

> **Relationship to §5.2/§5.5:** today hooks are wired into agent settings for the CLI fallback only. Under this target, that `settings.json` step becomes optional/legacy; the plugin tree is the single, engine-agnostic contract through which **hook-driven startup** runs (`SessionStart` executes at boot) and the agent stays tool/hook-capable on both the Coder Chat agent and any CLI agent.

---

## 8. Network & security posture

Worker workspaces have **heavily restricted egress** (`openflows-system-architecture.md` §13):

```
ALLOW tcp/443 → coder-control-plane   (workspace daemon + AI Gateway)
ALLOW tcp/443 → github.com            (git push/pull, issue/PR API)
ALLOW           redis                  (SharedStore coordination)
ALLOW           openflows-nexus:3000   (A2A relay, outbound dial)
DENY  everything else
```

Security properties:

- **No key exfiltration surface** — no LLM keys (AI Gateway in control plane) and no raw GitHub PATs (Coder external auth).
- **Agent framework runs centrally** — the workspace hosts the harness CLI (Harness A) and the Agent Harness plugin surface (Harness B), not a full agent runtime with keys.
- **Command control** — Agent Harness (B) `PreToolUse`/`Stop` hooks + A2A allowlist bound what the agent can run.
- **Tenant isolation** — Redis `ns:{tenant}:` prefixes keep one tenant's workspace state invisible to another's.
- **Review integrity** — SENTINEL and FORGE never share a filesystem; SENTINEL interacts with FORGE's code only through the audited A2A allowlist, never by touching FORGE's tree.

---

## 9. Lifecycle

1. **Provision** — Controller creates the workspace from the role template.
2. **Boot** — startup script installs Harness A (`openflows`, runtime pull, see §3.1) **and** installs the Agent Harness (B) package (see §3.1a) — hooks/skills/MCP/standards/persona — then clones the repo, starts heartbeat; FORGE starts the A2A executor. (Target: `openflows install` unifies the §7 plugin tree install.)
3. **Bind** — Controller creates a Coder chat bound to the workspace; the agent's **`SessionStart` hook runs automatically and seeds its opening context**, then the agent works via Agent Harness commands + hooks (see §5.5). The chat first message is at most a pointer to `~/.openflows/`.
4. **Work** — the agent coordinates through the Agent Harness (B) surface (startup hook + commands + policy hooks), which delegates to Harness A (`openflows worker`: dispatch → status → PR → handoff).
5. **Teardown** — the workspace is deleted after the PR merges (VESSEL), and the heartbeat key is removed.

Recovery is the Controller's job, not the workspace's: a stale heartbeat (>90s) or crashed chat marks the workspace for reconciliation, bounded to 3 recovery attempts before `awaiting_human` escalation (system doc §7.5).
